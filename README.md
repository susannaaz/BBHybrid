# BBHybrid

Used to calculate a set of well-educated constant spectral indices βS and βD and clean out the
spatially-constant part of the foregrounds at the map-level. In practice, a filter Q is returned
that de-projects the linear combinations of the data that follow the best-fit SEDs of the
foreground sources under consideration (dust and synchrotron).
